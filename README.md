WarehousePG (WHPG) is an advanced, fully featured, open
source data warehouse, based on Greenplum® Database and PostgreSQL. 
WarehousePG provides powerful and rapid analytics on
petabyte scale data volumes. Uniquely geared toward big data
analytics, WarehousePG is powered by the world’s most advanced
cost-based query optimizer delivering high analytical query
performance on large data volumes.

WarehousePG community. This section covers all you need to know if you want to see
your code or documentation changes be added to WarehousePG and appear in the
future releases.
