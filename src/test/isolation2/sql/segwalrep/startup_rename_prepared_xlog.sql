-- Test a bug where the last XLOG segment is renamed to .partial before prepared
-- transactions contained in it are recovered. This would result in segfault at
-- RecoverPreparedTransactions. The failure is well described in PG hackers:
-- https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/743b9b45a2d4013bd90b6a5cba8d6faeb717ee34.camel%40cybertec.at
-- However, in GP due to an older version of PG this error is masked by always caching 
-- the last opened xlog segment in XLogRead(). To actually trigger the failure we need to
-- create unfinished prepared transactions in TWO different xlog segments.

include: helpers/server_helpers.sql;

-- Allow extra time for mirror promotion to complete recovery to avoid
-- gprecoverseg BEGIN failures due to gang creation failure as some primaries
-- are not up. Setting these increase the number of retries in gang creation in
-- case segment is in recovery. Approximately we want to wait 30 seconds.
